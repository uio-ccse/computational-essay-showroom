# Showroom for computational essays
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/uio-ccse/computational-essay-showroom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/uio-ccse/computational-essay-showroom)

Essays go in the `content` folder, and to be visible in the sidebar of the webpage, they need a correct entry in the `toc.yml` file, which is the table of contents-file. 

There are already examples, so following existing patterns should work. Don't be afraid to break things.
