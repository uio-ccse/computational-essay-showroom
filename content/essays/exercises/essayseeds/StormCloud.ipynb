    "This notebook simulates a storm cloud, modeling it as a parallel-plate capacitor. It is based in large part on information from a report called \"The Physics of Lightning\" by Dwyer and Uman (*Dwyer, J. R., & Uman, M. A. (2014). The physics of lightning. Physics Reports, 534(4), 147–241. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2013.09.004*. You can also find a short description of the basic concepts at http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/lightning.html#c1). The code calculates the electric field a certain distance away from the cloud, at a specified observation position. There are some suggestions for investigation questions and the end, but you are welcome to play around with the parameters in the code, add or subtract different pieces, and see how it behaves for yourself as you decide what you want to use it to investigate."

    "2. Actual clouds have a certain thickness. How does this calculation change if the clouds are not thin sheets, but are 3D instead?\n",
    "3. It turns out that in reality, there are multiple layers of + and - charge, each with somewhat different charge densities (see *Marshall, T. C., & Stolzenburg, M. (1998). Estimates of cloud charge densities in thunderstorms. Journal of Geophysical Research, 103(D16), 19769–19775.*) What happens if there are extra layers of positive or negative charge in these clouds?\n",
