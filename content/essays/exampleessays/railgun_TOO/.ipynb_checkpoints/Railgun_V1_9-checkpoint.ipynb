    "A railgun is a device that uses magnetic forces to accelerate a projectile to extremely high speeds. In the simplest case, it consists of two parallel, current-carrying rails (wires, essentially) with a moveable, conductive bar (the projectile launched by the railgun) between them. The bar, because it is a conductive, experiences a force due to the magenetic fields of the rails, which accelerates it.\n",

    "The United States navy has recently debuted a 10-meter long railgun that can launch a 3.2 kg projectile at speeds up to 2500 m/s. Railguns are exciting, because theoretically they could represent a viable alternative to expensive chemical propulsion methods. While there are certainly many military applications to this type of system, one might also be able to use it for scientific purposes, such as launching satellites and supplies into orbit without the need for expensive, one-time-use rockets. However, how viable are railguns for these types of applications?\n",

    "In this notebook, we aim to estimate how much current one would need in order to use such a railgun to launch a 1kg package of supplies to the ISS, which is approximately 405 km above the surface of the earth. We will create a simple simulation of this system, then add in some complicating factors to try to get a more accurate calculation."
